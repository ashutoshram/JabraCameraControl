Steps to run and test the Mac based PanaCast API. 
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Run "python3 setup_jabracamera.py install". If this does not work, run "python3 setup_jabracamera.py build".
  3. Now you can run "python3 test.py" which will test the JabraCamera API basic capability. This can be enhanced such that any get/set or frame grab command can be called.
